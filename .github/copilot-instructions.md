# MMO FES Batch Data Process

UK Government (DEFRA/MMO) fisheries export service batch processor. Validates catch certificate landings data against external landing records, generates compliance reports, and publishes to Azure Service Bus queues.

## Core Workflow

Scheduled job → Fetch landings → Validate against catch certificates → Risk scoring → Report generation → Queue publishing → Blob storage archival

## Architecture

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Hapi HTTP Server (`src/server.ts`) | POST endpoints: `/v1/jobs/landings`, `/v1/jobs/purge` |
| Landing Consolidation Client | REST client for fetching/posting landing data |
| Azure Service Bus | Two queues: case management (dynamics) + DEFRA Trade (CHIP) |
| Azure Blob Storage | Reference data reads + validation report writes |
| MongoDB (Cosmos DB API) | Landing/certificate persistence |
| Cron Jobs | Species: monthly 1st at 9am, Vessels: daily at 9am |
| In-memory Cache (`src/data/cache.ts`) | Species, vessels, vessels of interest, exporter behavior, weighting |

## Key Dependencies

- `mmo-shared-reference-data` — shared types, validation queries (`ccQuery`), transformations
- `moment` — all dates via `moment.utc()` only
- `ajv` — JSON schema validation before queue publishing (schemas in `data/schemas/`)
- `node-cron` — scheduled job execution
- `mongoose` — MongoDB models extending shared library interfaces

## Commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Dev server | `npm start` |
| Build | `npm run build` |
| Test (coverage) | `npm test` |
| Test (watch) | `npm run test:watch` |
| Lint | `npm run lint` |

## Environment

Config via `ApplicationConfig.loadEnv()` in `src/config.ts`. Key groups: DB (`DB_CONNECTION_URI`, `DB_NAME`), Blob Storage (`REFERENCE_DATA_AZURE_STORAGE`), Service Bus (`AZURE_QUEUE_CONNECTION_STRING`, `REPORT_QUEUE`), Feature Flags (`ENABLE_CHIP_REPORTING`, `RUN_LANDING_REPROCESSING_JOB`, `VESSEL_NOT_FOUND_ENABLE`).

## Standards precedence (highest wins)

When guidance conflicts, follow this order:

1. **DEFRA Software Development Standards** (mandatory) — https://defra.github.io/software-development-standards/
2. **DEFRA Digital Service Manual** — https://digital.defra.gov.uk/service-manual
3. **GOV.UK Service Standard & Service Manual (GDS)** — https://www.gov.uk/service-manual
4. **Community best practice** — [OWASP Secure Coding Practices](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/), [12-factor](https://12factor.net/), widely-adopted Node.js/TypeScript patterns

> **DEFRA takes precedence over GDS. GDS takes precedence over community guidance.** Any deviation from a DEFRA standard MUST be raised as a formal exception through DEFRA's architectural governance (Delivery Architecture team: `delivery.architecture@defra.gov.uk`).

## The working framework (Triage → Read → Research → Clarify → Plan → Approval → Implement → Test → Iterate → Summarise)

This section is the **single source of truth** for the working loop. The custom agents ([Orchestrator](.github/agents/batch-data-process-orchestrator.agent.md), [Planner](.github/agents/batch-data-process-planner.agent.md), [Developer](.github/agents/batch-data-process-developer.agent.md) and [Reviewer](.github/agents/batch-data-process-reviewer.agent.md)) reference it and **must not restate or fork it**. The guiding principle is **match effort to risk**: do the least work that still delivers the change safely and to standard.

**Triage first — pick one of three gears by size and risk:**

- **Trivial** (typo, comment/doc tweak, a small localised change with no impact on architecture, validation, risk scoring, report generation, schema validation, persistence, external integrations, scheduled jobs, security or data correctness): skip the planner, research and review. Do a light **Read → Implement → Test → Summarise**, and research only the one point that is genuinely uncertain.
- **Standard** (a normal validation/risk-scoring/report change or fix, with **no** new architecture, external integration, or security surface): use a **lightweight inline plan** (a short Objective · Plan · Files · Validation · Risks note from the Developer agent — no heavyweight Planner), get approval, then implement and test. Run a **single** risk-scoped research pass **only if** something is genuinely uncertain.
- **Complex** (new architecture, schema changes, a new external integration (Service Bus, Blob Storage, MongoDB, landing consolidation), scheduled-job changes, a security surface, or multi-item delivery): run the full loop with the Planner agent below.

**Manual override.** The user can force a gear — e.g. "treat this as trivial", "just a lightweight/standard plan", "force the full plan", "skip the planner" — and that instruction wins over the automatic classification. Always honour a request for **more** rigour. When the user asks for **less** rigour than the risk warrants, comply but **briefly flag the risk first**, and never drop the approval gate or security for a change that genuinely touches architecture, external integrations, security or data correctness.

The loop (Standard and Complex; Trivial uses the light path above):

1. **Read** — Read the relevant files/config in the repo for context before acting. Never assume; verify.
2. **Research (single pass, risk-scoped)** — When something is genuinely uncertain — an unfamiliar or version-sensitive API, security, or DEFRA/GDS policy — do **one** thorough, risk-scoped research pass in the open and validate findings against DEFRA/GDS and framework/library guidance so advice reflects current APIs and policy. Cite sources. **Do not run a second, separate validation research round** — the plan is checked against these same cited sources. Well-trodden or cosmetic steps need little or no research.
3. **Clarify** — Ask the user targeted questions whenever requirements are ambiguous or missing. Surface requirement gaps explicitly with suggested fixes. Do not guess at intent.
4. **Plan** — For **Complex** work, delegate planning to the [Planner - Batch Data Process](.github/agents/batch-data-process-planner.agent.md) agent, which returns a complete plan with its research already cited. For **Standard** work, produce the lightweight inline plan directly — no separate planning agent. Either way, **check** the plan's risky/version-sensitive steps are covered and cited; only send a targeted revision back if a genuine gap is found (do not re-research what is already cited).
5. **Approval** — Present the plan to the user and obtain explicit approval before implementation. If changes are requested, update the plan and re-present. **Cap the plan → approve → implement cycle at 3 iterations**; if it is still unresolved, stop and surface the blocker to the user.
6. **Implement** — Deliver one task at a time (or parallel independent tasks) from the approved plan. Stay focused on the requested outcome; do not scope-creep or refactor unrelated code. When a change introduces or alters architecture, capture the decision as an ADR and update the relevant docs and ADRs **where the repo already keeps them** (e.g. `docs/`).
7. **Test / Validate** — Build (`npm run build`), run the test suite (`npm test`), lint (`npm run lint`), check errors, and confirm each task works before moving on.
8. **Iterate** — Refine until the user is satisfied with each task.
9. **Summarise** — End with a detailed **executive summary** of what changed, why, how it was validated, and any follow-ups or risks.

**Code review is optional and on-request.** A full code review is **not** part of the default loop. Run it only when the user asks for one. At the end of implementation, if no review has been run, **offer** one (a single Yes/No question); invoke the reviewer only on an explicit Yes.

## Workflow agents

Standard and Complex work is coordinated through four custom agents that all run the framework above:

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| [Orchestrator - Batch Data Process](.github/agents/batch-data-process-orchestrator.agent.md) | Plans, delegates, verifies and reports; owns the Yes/No user-approval gate and the end-of-work review offer. Does **not** implement. |
| [Planner - Batch Data Process](.github/agents/batch-data-process-planner.agent.md) | Internal planning subagent; produces the approval-ready plan and the single research pass behind it. Invoked for **Complex** work. |
| [Developer - Batch Data Process](.github/agents/batch-data-process-developer.agent.md) | Implements an already-approved plan end-to-end with tests; authors the lightweight inline plan for **Standard** work. |
| [Reviewer - Batch Data Process](.github/agents/batch-data-process-reviewer.agent.md) | Read-only review against DEFRA standards; reports findings by severity. **Optional, on-request only** — not run by default. |

Research (§4.2) uses the [deep-research-defra-alignment](.github/skills/deep-research-defra-alignment/SKILL.md) skill — a single risk-scoped pass run by the **Planner** (Complex work) or the **Developer** (Standard work). The [Speckit](.github/agents) agents (`speckit.*`) are a separate spec-driven toolset and are **not** part of this workflow.

## Skills

Use `/develop` for implementation, coding, and research tasks. Use `/unit-tests` for writing tests, coverage, and SonarQube issues.

## Defra standards and governance

This service must comply with [Defra software development standards](https://github.com/DEFRA/software-development-standards) — the single source of truth. The rules below encode those standards; they do not replace them. When a standard changes, update this file.

### Quality gates

All code must pass these checks before merging:

- Linter passes (`npm run lint`)
- All tests pass (`npm test`)
- Coverage ≥90% global (Statements/Branches/Functions/Lines), ≥95% core business logic, 100% error-handling and security-critical paths — no decrease from the SonarCloud baseline
- SonarQube/SonarCloud quality gate passes; security hotspots reviewed and resolved
- At least one approving review from another developer
- No unresolved security vulnerabilities in dependencies

### Security and PII

- Follow [OWASP Secure Coding Practices](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-coding-practices-quick-reference-guide/)
- Never commit secrets — load all configuration and credentials from environment variables (`src/config.ts`), never `process.env` scattered through code
- **Never log PII**: names, addresses, emails, phone numbers, NI numbers, bank details, usernames, passwords, API keys, tokens
- Validate and sanitise all external input; use parameterised queries for database access
- Avoid `eval`, dynamic `Function()`, or executing user-supplied data; validate and normalise file paths

### Dependencies

- New dependencies must be widely used, actively maintained, and compatible with the current Node.js LTS
- `mmo-shared-reference-data` is the SSOT for shared types and queries — never duplicate its logic
- Do not introduce a second HTTP framework, ORM, or date library without an approved exception

### Logging

- Structured logging via `bunyan` with bracketed context tags and `_correlationId` propagation
- Levels: `error` (failures), `warn` (handled but unexpected), `info` (business events), `debug` (development only)

### How Copilot should respond

- Follow conventions already in the codebase — check existing patterns first
- Prefer modifying existing files over creating new ones when the change fits naturally
- Provide minimal diffs touching only the necessary files; do not refactor unrelated code
- Always include or update tests for changed behaviour
- If a request conflicts with these instructions — a discouraged library, a skipped test, a hard-coded secret, or a broken quality gate — flag it explicitly and do not proceed silently

### Licence

All code is published under the [Open Government Licence v3.0](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/) unless an approved exception exists.
